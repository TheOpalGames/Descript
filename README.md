# Descript
Many modders know that MinecraftForge has been completely rewritten in 1.13, and this has been a big wall for me. I decided it was time to take action, so I started writing Descript, and I actually encountered several Forge issues on the way. Luckily, now that this is released, you do not have to struggle!

## Features
Currently, the only feature Descript has is Java coremods. We hope to add much more!
